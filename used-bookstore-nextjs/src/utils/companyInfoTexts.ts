Payment with credit card
After adding the products to your basket and providing your email and password, you will be directed to the payment screen.

Select the CREDIT CARD option. Simply click on the logo of your preferred card.

Enter the information as it appears on the credit card.

Before completing the purchase, verify the order details, payment method, and delivery address. They cannot be changed after finalization.

This payment method is also available for Televendas (telephone orders).

To enhance your security further, orders paid with a credit card undergo a verification of registration data.

If there is any registration discrepancy, Sebus will contact you.

The delivery time stated on the website will be considered after confirmation of registration data and approval of payment by the administrator, which may take up to 2 (two) business days.

Orders that exceed the card limit may be declined by the card administrator.

Credit cards issued abroad are not accepted.

Rules for payment with 2 (two) credit cards
Payment with two credit cards is valid only for orders with a total value above R$ 70.00.

The minimum value for the first credit card varies according to the chosen card's brand.

The second card's purchase amount is calculated automatically.

Different people's cards can be used, but they will be subject to Sebus' analysis and approval.

Some website promotions are exclusive to certain cards. There may be promotions that do not apply to orders paid with two cards.

The other rules are the same as those used for purchases with a single card.

Payment with bank slip
After adding the products to your basket and providing your email and password, you will be directed to the payment screen.

On this screen, click on the BANK SLIP option.

Before completing the purchase, verify the order details, payment method, and delivery address. They cannot be changed after finalization.

After completing the order, use the "print bank slip" option.

The bank slip is not sent by email (we only send the link to print it) or by mail. Once printed, it can be paid at your preferred bank agency or online, up to the due date on the document. After this date, it becomes invalid and cannot be reprinted.

This payment method is also available for Televendas (telephone orders).

Delivery time: After payment of the bank slip, the bank confirms receipt within up to 3 (three) business days. The stated delivery time begins counting only after payment approval and verification of registration data.

Failure to pay the bank slip by the due date results in its automatic cancellation, and the purchase is canceled without any cost.

How to print a second copy of the bank slip within the validity period

Access "My Account," locate your order, and use the "Print bank slip" option.

IMPORTANT: Products whose sale is prohibited to individuals under 18 years of age, such as knives, pocket knives, hunting and sports weapons, alcoholic beverages, and some electronic games, cannot be paid with a bank slip. In this case, the use of credit card or debit card is mandatory, even if the order includes other items not subject to the restriction.

The history of Sebus on the internet and its entire journey over more than 20 years of online presence.

The history of Lojas Sebus began in 1929 when a group of Americans founded the store with the aim of catering to a stable-income audience, offering lower prices and even a slogan that said "Nothing over 2,000 réis."

As you can imagine, the business was a great success! It grew, evolved, and adapted to new retail trends until in November 1999, it began selling its products online through the Sebus.com website.

Same name, different operations
The launch of Sebus.com was a milestone, especially due to the high technological investment required. The website positioned the brand in a new environment and established a unique means of interaction with consumers, who could now purchase products and services from Lojas Sebus via the internet.

However, despite the website's name directly associating it with physical stores, Sebus.com had a completely separate operation, being a subsidiary of Lojas Sebus.

Experimental phase
The website's launch on November 15, 1999, was marked by an experimental phase only in the city of Curitiba, with the goal of understanding the entire business routine and necessary operational procedures.

Combining these lessons with the competitive advantages of Lojas Sebus would allow for the development of a successful national internet strategy.

National launch
In February 2000, the website was launched nationwide and featured products sold in physical stores, as well as some higher-value-added product lines, optimizing the sales channel.

By the end of the launch year, the company already had 175,000 customers and was considered the most comprehensive e-commerce operator in the country, with a wide variety of products and one of the best delivery systems. Additionally, it had already received recognition such as:

- Best E-commerce Website in Brazil (Interactive Media Association – Golden Mouse Award 2000)

- Best E-commerce Website in Brazil (eBit – Gold Medal 2000)

- Best Online Store in Brazil 2000 (InfoExame – Best Website in Brazil 2000)
